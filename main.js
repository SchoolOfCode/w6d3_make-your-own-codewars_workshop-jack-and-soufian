/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

Here is a function that checks whether an email is valid, complete it so that it checks the email given is valid, returning true/false respectively. For the purpose of this we will assume the following are valid domains:

â€¢.com
â€¢.co.uk
â€¢.org
â€¢.net

Function output examples:

emailexample.com => returns false
email_example@address.com => returns true
emailexample@address.com => returns true
example?email@email.com => returns false

There are 2 sets of tests, a simple set and a complex set. The complex set includes some more strict tests checking for things like symbols other than "-, _, @" and incorrect syntax order.

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export function checkEmail(email){
    // code here
}

// plan:
// 1. pass in an email to the function and it checks whether it has proper email syntax
// 2. if it does return true
// 3. if it doesnt return false
